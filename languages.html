	 <p>I’m still at the beginning of my journey with Agda, but I’m really enjoying where it’s taking me. Agda gives me two things that I’ve been wanting in a programming language: interactive programming (or theorem proving, depending on your perspective) and formal verification at the code level.</p>
<p>I like that Agda lets me iteratively explore the possible inhabitants of a type signature and that my code won’t compile unless it is not only well-formed but also correct. The only thing that I don’t like about Agda is that proofs must be written explicitly; it sometimes junks up what would otherwise be easily readable and obviously provable code.</p>

	 <p>Since around 2014, or whenever they removed Boo, C# has been the de facto scripting language of the Unity game engine. I’ve used Unity a lot personally, professionally, and academically. This means that I can never really get away from C#. I don’t mess with anything .NET unless I have to; unfortunely, I often have to go outside the limited Mono implementation that comes with Unity to create those tasty machine learning features in some of my games.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain to people that C# is a largely imperative, object-oriented language with Java-like syntax and garbage collection without it sounding like a nightmare. The Unity profiler tells me that the garbage collector is almost always doing most of the work, but to my surprise it never seems to collect C# itself. I like LINQ because I love to write in a functional style and I hate when my users have excess cycles.</p>

	 <p>In the summer of 2021, I started learning Mandarin as a joke. Now I regularly listen to Chinese podcasts and watch Chinese cartoons, as the boomers say. I read way better than I write; I can write 我有一隻小狗, but I can’t write 𰻞. I can speak a little too, but the only time I’ve really practiced is when I visited my sister in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beyond its phonology, I like that the grammar of Chinese is pretty much entirely syntactic, rather than morphological. I find it fascinating how new meanings are suggested explicitly using smaller semantic units (i.e., Chinese characters). A personal favorite is the word for computer: 電腦, which can be parsed as “electric brain.” 請跟我說一點中文!!</p>

	 <p>English is my native language. I speak and write it well enough to present papers at international conferences. I grew up watching Shakespeare’s plays and I studied Latin and Greek in university, so I like to think that my understanding of English is more robust and flexible than most native speakers.</p>

	 <p>Attic Greek is a dialect of Greek that me and my friends speak in my attic. lol jk, it’s a dialect of Greek that originated in Athens in the Classical period. There was once a time when I could read Attic and Koine texts at an intermediate level, but that was over ten years ago now. Although I can still read Greek script, my use of Greek is now limited to mathematical contexts.</p>

	 <p>I like using Haskell because it lets me write code that looks like how I think about it. With its explicit type system and necessary purity, good style is basically a language feature. It’s easy to favor composition over inheritance if you just don’t have any inheritance. I find that I can write modules that just do what I need them to do and that I never have to refactor.</p>
<p>Although I can read a good deal of Haskell, I seldom have a chance to write any. It’s far too tempting to just hack something together in <a href="./languages.html#Python">Python</a>. I did, however, use a Haskell package called <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> to generate this site because I’d much rather read and modify others’ Haskell code over code written in any other language. The code just means what it says; I don’t even have to write a show instance to know what’s going on.</p>

	 <p>Like everybody else, I use JavaScript when deploying interactive programs on the web. Although I have used Node to create a simple web server, most of my JavaScript development is focused on creating front-end applications. I previously tried out Google’s Apps Script variant when making the <a href="https://www.gabrielecimolino.com/Lisbn/">Lisbn</a> add-on for Sheets. At some point I want to try TypeScript, because I find type checking to be a valuable sanity check in software development.</p>

	 <p>Latin is one of the ancient languages that I learned as part of my classical education. I mostly just understand Latin grammar and have very little experience actually reading it. My vocabulary is limited to words used in Wheelock’s Latin and the Lingua Latina per se Illustrata series. <latin>Vere discipvlvs improbvs svm</latin>.</p>

	 <p>Python is the language that I tend to use when I just need to get something working. There’s plenty of good packages for everything and its extremely flexible type system allows me to do whatever I want whenever I want. Bending Python to my will often leads me to write poorly organized code; but, hey, it works, I can copy it into a shareable notebook, and I can run it on every OS I use.</p>
